# Montagne

Windows Notepad Inspired Markdown Editor én Rust.

Made using [iced](https://github.com/iced-rs/iced) (and ❤).

## Installation

I would love to make an installer but not before an mvp is made.

### Cargo
Must have [cargo install](https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/getting-started/installation.html)ed (and git, but you already have it don't you).

1. Clone the repo and cd into it
```bash
git clone https://github.com/laughingclouds/Montagne.git
cd Montagne
```

2. Build
```bash
cargo build      # for debug build (larger in size)
```

```bash
cargo build -r   # for release builds
```
